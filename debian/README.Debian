Lynis for Debian
----------------

When execute Lynis from Debian menu, the program runs with the following
parameter:

lynis --no-colors

It makes a full system check, with the default profile file
(/etc/lynis/default.prf). Please adjust this config file with your needs.

For better perform, launch Lynis from a terminal, as root user,  with your best
configuration.
Lynis can be executed directly:

# lynis audit system
or
# lynis

After Lynis runs the system check, it creates the following two files with the
session log and the results of tests.

/var/log/lynis.log
/var/log/lynis-report.dat

See the manual page for more info.
