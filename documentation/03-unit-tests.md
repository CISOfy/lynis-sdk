# Unit Tests

It is common to change main components in a program. Such changes are needed to improve the functionality, or simplify things. The downside is that sometimes things might break, due to unforeseen events. For this reason we use unit tests. Each unit test has a particular target area to check. Such an area could be a function, and test it in different way.
