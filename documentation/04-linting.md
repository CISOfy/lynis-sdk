# Linting

Most software languages have a preferred way of writing the code. It should be simple to read, easy to understand, and as short as possible. Sometimes these principles conflict, or are intepreted differently by programmers, resulting in a bad coding style.

To combat "bad" code, we use several linters on our project, to check the code quality. This helps us keeping the code structured and uniform.

Used linters:
- Shellcheck

```
./lynis-devkit linters
```
