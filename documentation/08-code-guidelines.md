# Code Guidelines

Like any programming language, there are different ways to keep a project structured. It ranges from variable names, up to spacing. So we provide some guidelines to keep the structure and flexible enough for further expansion.

The Lynis project uses the following guidelines:

## Variables

All variables are in capital letters, with an underscore as word separator.

Examples:
*FOUND*
*SEARCH_DIRECTORY*

## Indentation

4 spaces (no tabs)

## Functions

Functions should be stored in include/functions as much as possible

# Style

* Indentation is done with 4 spaces (no tabs)
* Variables are capitalized, optional with an underscore to "split" words
